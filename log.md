### Day 10: February 25, 2022 

Progress: Learned and implemented Stack and Queue

Thoughts: How to make your chill time bit more productive? Will update the code implementation in thread once I reach home. Happy weekend guys ! üòâüçª <br>
([implementation : stack,](https://github.com/incogGod/100-days-of-code/blob/580a972ba27b308361412f71fe4b9e7f951032bd/dsa-implementation/stack.js))
([ implementation : queue](https://github.com/incogGod/100-days-of-code/blob/580a972ba27b308361412f71fe4b9e7f951032bd/dsa-implementation/queue.js))
### Day 9: February 24, 2022 

Progress: Learned and implemented Insertion Sort Algorithm in JavaScript 

Thoughts: In simple words it works like sorting an unsorted deck of cards. i.e. Pick a card(element) and put it in the correct relative position ([implementation](https://github.com/incogGod/100-days-of-code/blob/b9f890ef9b3ebe4208da2c56040d911006e27f6e/dsa-implementation/insertion-sort.js))

### Day 8: February 21, 2022 

Progress: Learned and implemented Selection Sort Algorithm in JavaScript 

Thoughts: It iterates through the array keeping track of the smallest number and at end of a full array iteration, the i·µó ∞ element is swapped with the smallest element. ([implementation](https://github.com/incogGod/100-days-of-code/blob/f870cf1dddf25fc7eb5e7ac92f4e1745bf510600/dsa-implementation/selection-sort.js))

### Day 7: February 20, 2022 

Progress: Learned and implemented Bubble Sort Algorithm in JavaScript. ([implementation](https://github.com/incogGod/100-days-of-code/blob/7dc2164d38f9b712d7dcecf66709110723ad0c69/dsa-implementation/bubble-sort.js))

Thoughts: The way bubble sort work is simple. It just check the adjacent elements and swap them if they are not in order till the array become fully sorted.

### Day 6: February 19, 2022 

Progress: Learned and implemented Binary Search Algorithm in JavaScript using recursive and iterative methods. ([implementation](https://github.com/incogGod/100-days-of-code/blob/176bec0205eeedd45adbc55e6376f75fda53db29/dsa-implementation/binary-search.js))

Thoughts: I think this is the second easiest algo out there, Linear Search is still the first ! :P

### Day 5: February 18, 2022 

Progress: Learned and implemented how async_await works in JavaScript 

Thoughts: aync await allows to run the remaining code while doing a heavier task in the background. ([implementation](https://github.com/incogGod/100-days-of-code/blob/e1d38d20fbe44a8fc5e7e891bd8afc1a8b67e5ad/misc/async-await.js))

### Day 4: February 17, 2022 

Progress: Watched tutorial and implemented Promise in JavaScript. ([implementation](https://github.com/incogGod/100-days-of-code/blob/302ee21dfdbb0f92781ed10603078839c547040e/misc/promise.js))

Thoughts: Promise makes callbacks easy

### Day 3: February 16, 2022 

Progress: freeCodeCamp's Basic JavaScript Course; Finished 100% including assignments. (Portions covered today: loops, objects, recursion)

Thoughts: Spent much time on recursion, should spent a little more to make it thorough.

### Day 2: February 15, 2022 

Progress: freeCodeCamp's #JavaScript Course; Finished 66% including assignments. (Portions covered today: conditions, function, scopes)

Thoughts: Todays exercises were slightly tougher than day1's.

### Day 1: February 14, 2022 

Progress: freeCodeCamp Basic [JavaScript Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/) : Completed 48% including assignments. (Portion includes variables, operators, array methods)

Thoughts: Could finish the exercises easily. Liked the way of teaching by freeCodeCamp which gives hands on while learning, which helps in understading the concepts better.
