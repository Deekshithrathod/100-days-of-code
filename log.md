### Day 1: February 14, 2022 

Today's Progress: freeCodeCamp Basic [JavaScript Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/) : Completed 48% including assignments. (Portion includes variables, operators, array methods)

Thoughts: Could finish the exercises easily. Liked the way of teaching by freeCodeCamp which gives hands on while learning, which helps in understading the concepts better.
